## 🚀 Overview

**Vitality AI** is building modern, developer-friendly storage systems for high-throughput, low-latency workloads — including **AI/ML pipelines**, **databases**, and **analytics engines**.

We embrace **Storage Disaggregated Architectures (SDA)**, enabling clean separation between compute and storage. Our architecture focuses on:
- Clean low-level **primitives** for objects, blocks, and streams
- High-throughput paths optimized for training and query workloads
- Support for both large and small data sizes
- Modular SDKs for application integration
